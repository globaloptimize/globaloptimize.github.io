<h2>Research interests</h2>

<ul>
  
  <li> <p> Reinforcement learning (security, non-stationarity, safety, partial observability, human-in-the-loop, curse-of-multi-agent), bandit learning and online learning (power-of-2-arms, switching costs, side information), with applications in Edge AI (robotics, autonomous driving, recommendation systems), healthcare, language processing, and generative AI.<br /></p>

  </li>  
  
  <li> <p> Online convex optimization (switching costs, prediction, uncertainty), with applications in networking, power systems, cyber-physical systems, wireless communication, date centers, cloud computing, and economics.<br /></p>

  </li>
  
  <li> <p> Theoretical performance analysis, e.g., competitive ratio, regret, sample complexity, and convergence rate.<br /></p>
